[How many chips is the minimum?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-21/minimum-chips-size-debate-brandon-gatgens/11772776)

![Some chips](chips.png)

Minimum chips implements mathematical operations
on a large array for use with high performance
computing systems.

The array is split into blocks, each one of which
is shared between one or more MPI processes.
The code is optionally accelerated with OpenMP pragmas.

Both Monte-Carlo simulations of material properties,
and solvers for integral equations for the 
structures of fluids have been built on
the foundation implemented in `minimum_chips`.

The most expensive step in the solution of
integral equations for the structures of fluids
of particles with internal structure is ideal
for GPGPU acceleration. CUDA is used for this
step.
